This is the captstone project created as part of the course "Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence." 

The dataset used for this modeling has been retrieved from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamishraml/laptops

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND HAS THE FOLLOWING STEPS YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED - 1. Data Pipeliine that scrapes e-commerce websites once every month 
                                                                                                 -- Use scraping tools to get important info(price, ram, cpu, gpu)
                                                                                                 -- Clean out anomalies
                                                                                                 -- exploratory analysis for further cleaning/ ML Decisions
                                                                                                 -- Apply ML to train the model 
                                                                                             2. Add in more funcitonality to predict more than just price
